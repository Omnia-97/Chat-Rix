# Chat-Rix

Chat-Rix is a chat application built with Flutter that allows users with similar interests to communicate with each other. It provides a set of rooms where users can join and engage in conversations.

## Introduction

Chat-Rix started as a simple chat application aimed at facilitating communication between users sharing common interests. I've laid the foundation for a robust and feature-rich chat platform. As I move forward, My goal is to continually enhance and expand Chat-Rix to provide an even more immersive and engaging experience for app users.

## Features üöÄ

- **Room-based Chat**: Users can join rooms based on their interests and engage in conversations with other users in the same room.
- **Secure Authentication**: Users can sign in securely using Firebase Authentication.
- **Real-time Messaging**: Chat messages are stored securely in Cloud Firestore, providing real-time synchronization.
- **Image Sharing**: Users can share images within chat conversations.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive across various screen sizes and orientations.

## Tech Stack üíª

- **MVVM Architecture**: The project is structured using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern for better separation of concerns and maintainability.
- **State Management**: Utilizes the Provider package for efficient state management.
- **Firebase Services**: Firebase Authentication for user authentication and Cloud Firestore for real-time database storage.
- **Flutter Screen Util**: Ensures a responsive design across different devices.
